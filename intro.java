/*Java feature :- 

1.Simple =  easy to learn , removed rarely used features like explicit pointers , operator overloading,
            no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in 
            Java.

2.Robust =  strong memory mangement means efficiently allocated and deallocated memory space , 
            avoid memory leaks , minimize the risk of error and crashes.It have Exception handling ,
            type checking features.

3.Platform independent = It's JVM converts the code into bytecode that is platform independent and 
                         can be run on any os and any other language is also converted into bytecode 
                         would be platform independent.Java provides software-based platform.
                        WORA (Write Once and Run Anywhere).

4.Portable = can carry to any platform in form of bytecode

5.Secure = have no pointer , uses runtime environment of it's own , not of its platform like C,C++
           Classloader = provide security by separting the packages of classes of local file from 
                         those imported from internet.
            

6.OOPs = Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects 
        that incorporate both data(attribute) and behavior(method or function).Contains = class ,objects,
        encapsulation , polymorphism , inheritence and abstraction

7.Archietectural neutral = There is no implementation dependent feature eg. int size is not based *32 bit
                           system and 64 bit system

8.High performance = have faster than any interpreted language because bytecode is close to native
                     language(C,C++) but slower that a compiler language.

9.Dynamic =  It support dynamic loading(load on demand) of classes.

10.Interpreted = line by line execution
11.Distributed = with this we can access files by calling the method from any machine on internet.

12.Multithreaded = Java can write program that runs multiple task at a time by defining threads.
                    Here multiple thread share common memory area.
